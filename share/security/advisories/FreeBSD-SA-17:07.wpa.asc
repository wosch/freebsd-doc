For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) is a security protocol developed by the
Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.

hostapd and wpa_supplicant are implementations of user space daemon for
access points and wireless client that implements the WPA2 protocol.

II.  Problem Description

A vulnerability was found in how a number of implementations can be
triggered to reconfigure WPA/WPA2/RSN keys (TK, GTK, or IGTK) by
replaying a specific frame that is used to manage the keys.

III. Impact

Such reinstallation of the encryption key can result in two different
types of vulnerabilities: disabling replay protection and significantly
reducing the security of encryption to the point of allowing frames to
be decrypted or some parts of the keys to be determined by an attacker
depending on which cipher is used.

IV.  Workaround

An updated version of wpa_supplicant is available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection. Install version 2.6_2 or later of the
security/wpa_supplicant port/pkg. Once installed, update /etc/rc.conf
to use the new binary:

wpa_supplicant_program="/usr/local/sbin/wpa_supplicant"

and restart networking.

An updated version of hostapd is available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection. Install version 2.6_1 or later of the net/hostapd port/pkg.
Once installed, update /etc/rc.conf to use the new binary:

hostapd_program="/usr/local/sbin/hostapd"

and restart hostapd.

V.   Solution

Patches are currently available for stable/11, releng/11.0, and
releng/11.1. Patches for stable/10, releng/10.3, and releng/10.4 are
still being evaluated.

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Restart the Wi-Fi network interfaces/hostapd or reboot the system.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Restart the Wi-Fi network interfaces/hostapd or reboot the system.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

[FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE, 11.1-RELEASE, and 11-STABLE]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:07/wpa-11.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:07/wpa-11.patch.asc
# gpg --verify wpa-11.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details
